This structure is designed to keep the project organized and modular, with dedicated directories for each feature and functionality. Here’s a breakdown of some of the core directories:

config: Contains configurations for database connections, environment variables, and logging.
controllers: Handles incoming requests, communicates with services, and sends responses.
integrations: Contains integrations with external systems like Slack, Google Calendar, and payroll.
middlewares: Includes middleware for authentication, error handling, and role-based access control.
models: Contains Mongoose schemas for MongoDB, representing entities like employees, surveys, projects, and more.
routes: Defines all routes, organized by feature.
services: Business logic for each module, allowing separation of concerns from the controllers.
utils: Contains utility files for error handling, token management, and validation.
This structure is highly modular and scalable, supporting a wide range of features while maintaining clean separation between different aspects of the application. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to dive deeper into!
